You take the SAT and score 1100. The mean score for the SAT is 1026 and the standard
deviation is 209. How well did you score on the test compared to the average test taker?

from scipy import stats as st

mean = 1026
std_dev = 209
my_score = 1100

z = (my_score - mean) / std_dev
percent = st.norm.cdf(z) * 100
print("I score {:.2f}%, which is {:.2f}% above the avarage.".format(percent,percent-50))
